# Write a Python script to generate and print a dictionary that contains a number (between 1 and n) in the form (x, x*x).
# Sample Dictionary ( n = 5) :
# Expected Output : {1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25}

d = {1: 10, 2: 20}
print(d.items())
print(d.keys())
print(d.values())

# result = {}
# n = 5

# for i in range(n):

#   result[?] = ?
# print(result)
